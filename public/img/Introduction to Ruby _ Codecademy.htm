            <p>Because everything in Ruby is an object (more on this later), everything in Ruby has certain built-in abilities called <strong>methods</strong>. You can think of methods as "skills" that certain objects have. For instance, strings (words or phrases) have built-in methods that can tell you the length of the string, reverse the string, and more.</p>

<p>We also promised to tell you more about the <strong>interpreter</strong>. The interpreter is the program that takes the code you write and runs it. You type code in the <strong>editor</strong>, the interpreter reads your code, and it shows you the result of running your code in the <strong>console</strong> (the bottom window on the right).</p>
